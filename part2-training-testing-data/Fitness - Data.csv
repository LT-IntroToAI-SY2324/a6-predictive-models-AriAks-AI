In addition to all that I have been confirmed that the wide squat from can make you stronger and does not increase anymore likelyhood for injury, but I should still reconsider what my form is for the front squat because I am not so sure for that. Something that I thnk could help me with my squat is pin squats and heavy walkouts which will prime my nervous system for more weight. (Just as i predicted) - Day 50!!",225,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.15,

From this point on I want to hit a highish training max of 135 (however eventually I want to make that number higher to another easy to hit number). This will help me see that consistancy is really what gives you the gain in this type of program. Yesterday I squated for the first time after being on vacation and I was sore today for the first time in quite a while. . On a completely sepperate note, I thing that my hamstrings are a lot weaker than my glutes I feel that this is important to fix if I am going to want to increase my squat further without devloping muscle imbalances. I realized this after trying to hamstring curl 20 pounds while laying on the ground, I wasnt even able to do it. The reason that I think this is an issue, is because if you are able to ""grind through"" a squat than you have a strong back. I am able to do this however I dont think that I have the amound of power necissary to increase my squat. . Some exercises that I think will help me do it are A. Romainain deadlift; I think that this will help my squat because it very much focuses the hamstring as the main muscle in the leg being used to lift. B Box squats; I think that these will serve the double pourpose of increasing my strength, but it will also help me increase the explosiveness that I need to drive off tthe ground with. I also think that I never have throuble getting back to 90* after I squat, but then I have trouble pushing back into the straight knee possition. C Assisted Ham string raises; however im not sure how I am going to get to do this one at home, I think that it will do a good job of evening out the muscles in my legs.",205,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

END OF YEAR (lofty goals): B: 225, S: 315, D: 405                              In addition to this I'd like to be squating everyday along with the pushups, deadlifting 2 or 3 times a week, and be able to do all my goals while maintaining the same level of body fat that I am currently at. In order to do this I think that I should make meals for school at the begining of every week and stop eating so much fast food. Maintaning the habbits that i am trying to develop is the most important part of this entire process, because if I am always putting in the effort even when I dont want to, I think that I will still continue to get stronger and develop as an athelete. I want to make a better tracking process to help myself easily look back on my workouts and anaylise what is helping me get stronger and where I hit my platoues. Something that I think would help with this is creating training blocks where I start focusing on a secondary or ""support"" excersise for about a month to help strengthen the muscles that are holding me back in the big 3 lifts.                                                                                                                       Although I dont really enjoy training bench, I want to see if doing the pushups will be an adequit amount of tension on the chest and triceps to help increase my bench. At some point in the year (hopefully earlier on) I would like to start taking protein powder after my workouts to help maximise the potential that I gain from each of my sessions. However I need to do adequite research on the effects of taking protein powder at my age and if it can lead to bad results later down the line. Today after doing the splits streches before my workout I noticed that I was able to go far lower in my squats than i usually can, this leads me to belive that I have VERY tight hip flexors and why squat depth would benifit from me learning the splits (WHICH IS ANOTHER RESOULUTION) that I have for this year. Along with this working on my form would be a good thing for me to start doing for example a deload week once a month where I work on my form in each of my lifts. Because  I think that a good part of lifting has nothing to do with the amount of force that you can apply, but more in the efficency that you apply it with. ",205,180,,,,,,,,,,,0.6,2.05,,,,

Although I no longer am on a squat everyday program -- because it makes me too sore and tired during my sport seasons and I need to be able to do other things -- Something that I have been doing recently is climbing and I can tell that it is making my grip stronger. On this day I hit a new squat PR of 255 which is quite a big number for me to hit because it is going above 250 which to me is a big deal and it is the first PR that I have (attempted or) hit from quite a while before this. I have not benched in months because of what it does to my shoulders however I do think that my PR would probably be higher than the last time I did it because I was able to do lighter rep work and hit 135x4 which is the most I have ever done with that. I want to encorparate more chest training for my physical appearance and try to get my bench press to a much more respectable spot.                                                                                                        Looking at the PR that I just hit, I do see that my form is actually still quite good and I don't need more work on that front. However afterwards my lower back did feel some soreness which could be from injury or just from normal fatigue. My nearest goal that I have for my squat is hitting 225x5 because I think that it is a huge acomplishment and would continue to give me the motivation. For deadlfiting I don't really know how to program in sets and how to continue to grow my numbers but recently I have been trying to do 225x5 (3 sets) and sometimes using the trap bar to work up with higher weights and mix up the training. I think that this will help my gain strength but I do want to start doing this multiple times a week without fail to push me over the three plate line.

I want to grow my chest or just focus on bodybuilding while relaxing for the hernia to go back down. I'm not quite sure how i'm gonna do that but I am going to figure something else out. I want to learn if leg curls and extenstions put uneeded pressure on my hernia or not. Moving on from this point I want to start working on buildling up my chest and my arms while also finding a way to maintain the muscle that I have already built in my upper body. I think that growing my chest and arms could assist in the constant increase and pushing through limitations in my other body parts.                                                                                                                                           I would also like to learn how to set up specified back and leg days so that I can return to being on a set schedule for the gym even if it is not powerliftiing. While speaking with dad I thought that maybe next week when I have my doctors appointement to look at the hernia because I feel no pain while I am actually in the proccess of lifting I might not even ahve to get the surgery before I go back to weightligthing. However, even if I am cleared to go back to powerlifting, I want to maintain the habbit of bench press because it will grow my chest and allow for other lifts to increase (also it  willl look more asthetically pleasing)",,22,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel as though part of the reason that I am getting doms in my lowerback from squating is because my core does not have A. the strength to  resist movement during the squat & B. The endurance to last throughout a longer set without movement. I hope that by developing the abs (don't mind the hypertrophy) I will be able to hold a stronger brace throughout squat and deadlift. I also think that it can have some carry over into remaining upright during defensive and long attack actions in fencing.
