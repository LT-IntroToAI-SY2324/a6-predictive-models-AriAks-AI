# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This model was more effective because it used ALOT more data and it was also able to create more data to increase accuract

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?

The R squared coefficicent tells me that it is alot more accurate than the last one because it is closer to one

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.

Yes, I think that this model is accurate because when I look at the plotted data along with the line of best fit that it created, I can see that all the data looks like it would fit in.
