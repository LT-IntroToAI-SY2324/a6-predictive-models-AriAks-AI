# Part 4 - Classification Writeup

After completing `a6_part4.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. Comment out the StandardScaler and re-run your test. How accurate is the model? Why is that?
The acurracty went down from .8 to .6. This is because the data is no longer standaradized with the sizing and is less easy for the model to deal with.
2. How accurate is the model with the StandardScaler? Is this model accurate enough for the given use case? Explain.
With stqandard scaler the model is 80% effective, which I consider to be very accurate and effective to use. I think that because the usecase is not very emergency based and is not the most needed ugent thing, it can be used for this usecase.
3. Looking at the predicted and actual results, how did the model do? Was there a pattern to the inputs that the model was incorrect about?
For me it is hard to see a difference between the two because I am not a computer and cannot read 1's and 0's. Th emodel did pretty well and got it right 80% of the time though so i'm impressed.
4. Would a 34 year old Female who makes 56000 a year buy an SUV according to the model? Remember to scale the data before running it through the model.

No she would not buy the SUV
