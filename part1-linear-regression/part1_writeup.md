# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?

The r squared value is the measuure of the goodness of the model. (this is what google says) As far as I can tell, the r squred value is just the number shcking the accuracy of the linear regression line

2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?

137.46

3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?

I think that it is sorta accurate but is not incredibly useful becuase the data is so varied between individual points( peopole), Meaning that it is hard to utilize data when it doesn't show a clear picture or when it is such a varying value.
