# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
My r squared value is 0.86. This menas that the model is right about 0.86 of the time.
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
I think that this is a realatively accurate guess but it is no where near perfect
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
A 10 yeqr old car with 89000 iles would be worth 8999.85$
A 20 year old car with 150000 would be 2155 $
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?

I think tit means that becuase the age is so high, that the car no longer has va;ue and would cost money to sell, hgowever I think in real life this would not be true but that car is not realisticly going to get sold for alot of money
